# Seismic-challenge-Space-Apps/Hypernova Aerospace IPN Team

We developed an automatic events detector we decided that we can't predict with an sysmic event, so the importance of the project is to detec every event near to low frequencies around 0.5 to 1 Hz; we also notice, it's to hard doing our process of analysing one by one datasets, our process takes all the datasets, detects the events and mark those events. In this challenge we identify given events from the Apollo missions and InSight Mars lander datasets; the process remove the noise for high frequencies obtaining a clean signal by event detection, and finally, the process mark all those events.
